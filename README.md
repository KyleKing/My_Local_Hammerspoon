# My Hammerspoon Config

**Archived**: I have replaced the functionality in Hammerspoon with OTS apps, such as [Hookshot](https://hookshot.app/) - custom tiling; [Charmstone](https://charmstone.app/) - app switching; and [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - launch predefined set of applications

See [the `archive/2016` branch](https://github.com/KyleKing/My_Local_Hammerspoon/tree/archive/2016) for the project before it was pared down to the minimum functionality.
